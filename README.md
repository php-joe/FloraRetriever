#Overview

FloraRetriever is an online tool to collect plant information from the field, submit it to a database, and report. This is a project for the 2015 backend web development course (weblab) sponsored by Front Range Community College.

The scope of the project has been extended to include bird information as well as user registration and login. The login system allows for users to track and verify the data they submit. Unregistered users (guests) may also submit data but are required to enter a captcha every time.

#Who#
The project has 3 user types: observer, administrative, researcher. The observer needs to be able to submit data in as quick and efficient manner. The researcher needs to be able to retrieve the data in the excel, csv, and pdf formats. The administrator needs to be able to access the database through a url.

#What#
##The observer is just gathering and submitting information: ##
* Unique ID: automated per transaction (alpha numeric)
* Date/Time: if current timestamp else ask for date/time
* Name: Text Field
* Plant Name: Text Field
* Soil Type: Dropbox (limited choices)
* Weather: Text field (requirement) - (api if time allows)
* Location: Text field (requirement) - (Geoscope api if time allows)
* Additional Notes: Text Field

##The researcher needs to be able to quickly access via clicking on a link. ##
* Export to excel, csv, and pdf formats
* This is secure

##The administrator needs access to the database##
* may view and edit any submit
* Export to excel, csv, and pdf formats
* Phpmyadmin login information, database built to be easily understood
* This is secure

#How#
To complete this setup we will be using html, css (bootsrtap), php, jquery, javascript, and mysql. The database will be mysql as thatâ€™s what the administrator is familiar with. We will first build the front-end to gather the information, then proceed with the backend to create the database, and finally link it together. If time allows we will use an additional third party API to streamline the process.
